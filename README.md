ScurryPy is a fully extensible foundation for Discord bots and frameworks. 
Build anything from a simple bot to a complete custom framework, with the architecture entirely up to you.

> **Tip**: *Think of ScurryPy like a sandbox for Discord’s API: a reliable foundation where you control everything you build.*

## Philosophy

ScurryPy is built on one idea:
✨*clarity over magic* ✨

* Every operation is explicit
* No hidden behavior or black boxes
* Components do *one* job and do it predictably

This philosophy ensures that you can extend, compose, and control every part of your bot without hidden surprises.

If you want to understand your bot rather than fight it, you're in the right place.

## Features

The following are baked into ScurryPy:

* Lightweight core
* Rate limit handling
* Automatic session & gateway management
* Automatic sharding
* Predictable event models and resource classes

Your focus is building what you want.
